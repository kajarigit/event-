## 🎯 How Competition Works

### Department-Based Competition
- You compete **ONLY** with stalls from **your own department**
- Example: If you're CSE department, you only compete with other CSE stalls
- Each department has its own leaderboard

### Ranking Calculation
Stalls are ranked by:
1. **Vote Count** (primary) - More votes = higher rank
2. **Average Rating** (tiebreaker) - If votes are equal, better rating wins
3. **Stall Name** (final tiebreaker) - Alphabetical order

### Real-Time Updates
- Rankings update **every 5 seconds** automatically
- No need to refresh the page
- Position changes are instant
